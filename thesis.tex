        This thesis presents the design and implementation of Jaculus, a platform for programming microcontrollers using JavaScript and TypeScript. The platform consists of a runtime for the microcontroller and a command-line tool for accessing the device. The runtime is built around the QuickJS JavaScript engine and provides a high-level abstraction over JavaScript concepts to make creating new native features as easy as possible. The command-line tool can be used to connect to the device, upload source code, and control the device.

        The runtime is then ported to the ESP32 and ESP32-S3 series of microcontrollers with several native modules. The port is then used to demonstrate the usage of Jaculus and is evaluated against other similar solutions.

        I would like to thank everyone who helped me make this thesis possible, especially my advisor Jan Mrázek, for his guidance and advice. I would also like to thank everyone from Robotárna for their support, feedback, and constant encouragement. Not to be forgotten are my friends, who for months had to constantly listen to me talking about Jaculus\footnote{\scriptsize{I am sorry, it is going to happen again.}} and, nevertheless, helped me proofread this thesis. Finally, I would like to thank my family for their support and bottomless patience.
